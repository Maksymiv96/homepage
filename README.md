My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé. Basically it's just a test task for [BSA18](https://academy.binary-studio.com/#!/academy-about). Anyway, you can read her my biography and also find my contacts.  
For creating this I used HTML and CSS. Hosting is only on Github pages, because it's free and it's simple to use.
Have fun.
